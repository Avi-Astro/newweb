<h3>Income Tax Return (ITR)</h3>
	<p>Income Tax Return is a form which a person is supposed to submit to the Income Tax Department of India. It contains information about the person’s income and the taxes to be paid on it during the year. Information filed in ITR should pertain to a particular financial year, i.e. starting on 1st April and ending on 31st March of the next year.</p>
	<p>Income can be of various forms such as :</p>
	<p>Income from salary</p>
	<P>Profits and gains from business and profession</p>
	<P>Income from house property</p>
	<P>Income from capital gains</p>
	<P>Income from other sources such as dividend, interest on deposits, royalty income, winning on lottery, etc.</p>
	<P>The Income Tax Department has prescribed 7 types of ITR forms - ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6, ITR-7 and applicability of the form will depend on the nature and amount of income and the type of taxpayer.</p>

<h3>Goods and Services Tax (GST)</h3>
	<p>Goods and Services Tax is a successor to VAT used in India on the supply of goods and services. GST is a digitalized form of VAT where you can also track the goods & services. Both VAT and GST have the same taxation slabs. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect taxes except a few state taxes. Multi-staged as it is, the GST is imposed at every step in the production process, but is meant to be refunded to all parties in the various stages of production other than the final consumer and as a destination-based tax, it is collected from point of consumption and not point of origin like previous taxes.</p>
	<p>Goods and services are divided into five different tax slabs for collection of tax: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. However, petroleum products, alcoholic drinks, and electricity are not taxed under GST and instead are taxed separately by the individual state governments, as per the previous tax system.[citation needed] There is a special rate of 0.25% on rough precious and semi-precious stones and 3% on gold.[1] In addition a cess of 22% or other rates on top of 28% GST applies on several items like aerated drinks, luxury cars and tobacco products.[2] Pre-GST, the statutory tax rate for most goods was about 26.5%; post-GST, most goods are expected to be in the 18% tax range.</p>
	<p>The tax came into effect from 1 July 2017 through the implementation of the One Hundred and First Amendment of the Constitution of India by the Indian government. The GST replaced existing multiple taxes levied by the central and state governments.</p>

<h3>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)</h3>
	<p>Tax Deducted at Source is a procedure implemented by the Indian government to collect taxes at the source of income. A certain percentage of tax is deducted by the payer at the time of making payments to the receiver, and this amount is then remitted to the government. TDS is applicable to a wide range of income categories such as salaries, interest on fixed deposits, rent, commissions, etc. TDS helps prevent tax evasion and understanding it is crucial for both payers and receivers of income in India.</p>
	<p>TDS has to be deducted at the rates prescribed by the tax department. The company or person that makes the payment after deducting TDS is called a deductor and the company or person receiving the payment is called the deducted.</p> 
	<p>It is the deductor’s responsibility to deduct TDS before making the payment and deposit the same with the government. TDS is deducted irrespective of the mode of payment–cash, cheque or credit–and is linked to the PAN of the deductor and deducted.</p>

<h3>Permanent Account Number (PAN)</h3>
	<p>Permanent Account Number or PAN is a means of identifying various taxpayers in the country. Pan Card is a 10-digit unique identification alphanumeric number (containing both alphabets and numbers) assigned to Indians, mostly to those who pay tax.</p>
	<p>The PAN system of identification is a computer-based system that assigns a unique identification number to every Indian tax paying entity. Through this method, all tax-related information for a person is recorded against a single PAN number, which acts as the primary key for storage of information. This is shared across the country and hence no two people on tax paying entities can have the same PAN.</p>
	<p>When PAN is allotted to an entity, a PAN Card is provided by the Income Tax Department. While PAN is a number, PAN Card is a physical card that has your PAN as well as name, date of birth, father’s or spouse’s name, and photograph. Copies of this card can be submitted as proof of identity or date of birth.</p>
	<p>Your PAN Card is valid for lifetime because it is unaffected by any change in address.</p>
